# Week 3

## Weekly Goals:
- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through the 'Battle' paired programming exercise to learn how to build a web app.
- Attend the second debugging workshop and follow the debugging practical to debug simple web app.
- Read up on the basics of web design and how the web works to ensure my understanding is correct.
- Use the Battle exercise and other practicals from the weekly outline to gain an understanding of MVC pattern.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- **Battle Challenge** - Creation of a simple web app. Demonstrates implementation of GET/POST methods using Sinatra and Capybara. Projects split into lib/spec/views folders to preserve separation of concerns. Demonstrates MVC - the model is represented by Ruby classes which are being called by the controller (app.rb), which defines what happens on each page of the web app. The view comprises of the files contained in the views folder, containing what is displayed in the browser when it's called. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/battle.git).
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge** - A slightly more complicated web app with more attention paid to the layout/HTML in the views files. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/rps-challenge.git).
- Created a process model of the Battle App to better understand the MVC pattern. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/Battle-Process-Modelling.git).

- EVIDENCE: Process model repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/Battle-Process-Modelling.git).


# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Almost - I met most of my goals but I would have benefitted from more time to work on debugging practicals. I've found that debugging a web app is quite different to debugging the TDD apps that we were working on in previous weeks - the error messages are a bit less specific.


### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- I'm struggling to find the time to go into as much detail on each learning topic as I'd like. I would have liked to have spent more time understanding the theory of the MVC pattern and how this applies to building web apps - I'm still struggling to grasp how the different files within a web app interact together.
