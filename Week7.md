# Week 7

## Weekly Goals:
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
- Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through the afternoon pairing challenge to create a web app using Javascript.
- Do my own reading around the DOM API to ensure my understanding.
- Work through the materials provided in the weekly outline to learn more about JS web apps.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- Worked through half of the afternoon 'Notes App' challenge (no GitHub repo, materials held locally due to several files being used).
- Doing my own reading on the DOM and working through Codecademy modules (see below).


## Daily Goals

# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Yes, but my goals definitely changed as the week went on. I really struggled with the materials for the afternoon challenge (something which I have fed back/chatted to two coaches about) and I felt that they were hurting my confidence because I started to feel like I wasn't even understanding the basics. However, I decided to change my focus and instead work through some Codecademy materials to solify my understanding of the JS basics and how they differ from Ruby to make sure that I was prepared for next week's group project. 

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- I don't think there was anything from this week that I'd change. I identified that I wasn't understanding the afternoon materials and gave this feedback to a coach, then made a plan to supplement my own learning to help me to move past this.
