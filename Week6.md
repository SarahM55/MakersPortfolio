# Week 6

## Weekly Goals:
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through the afternoon pairing challenge to create an app using Javascript.
- Attend the week's workshops to learn more about Javascript.
- Do my own reading on Javascript structures and best practices to enhance my understanding.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- Completed the [Thermostat](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-fundamentals#sequence) challenge. No 'formal' repo for this as the challenges were carried out in different diretories (held locally).
- Re-did the weekend [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/SarahM55/bowling-challenge.git) in JavaScript.
- Completed a number of Code Wars challenges (see below).

# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Yes. I think I was able to spend a good amount of time re-reading the steps of the afternoon challenge that I'd covered in my pairing sessions then doing Code Wars challenges to reinforce my learning. After discussing with my pairing partners, I was able to have shorter pairing sessions this week which really helped me - I often find that when I'm working through steps with a pair, I'm not really taking in what we're doing and can often lean too heavily on my partner if I don't understand something, so taking some extra time to re-read things on my own made a big difference.

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- I'd like to keep taking a bit of extra time in the afternoons for reading/self learning. I feel that the majority of our learning on the course at the moment is done via the afternoon challenges so I want to make sure that I'm really understanding these before moving on.
