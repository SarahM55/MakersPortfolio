# Week 8+9

## Weekly Goals:
- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs.
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges).
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives.
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow.
- Give and receive meaningful code review.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through a two week long group-based project where we will build a clone of Facebook.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- **Acebook Challenge** - Creation of a web app which mimics the behaviour of 'Facebook'. Spent two weeks working in a group of seven to organsie our own work using [XP Values](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/makersbnb#xp-values) to guide our behaviour and the [Development Workflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/makersbnb#development-workflow) to follow the correct process for raising issues, branching, reviewing, approving, and merging our code. Started by merging a seed repository and using our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/KqdLIQ2d/maker-mate) board to create an MVP which we built over the first few days. We gradually added more complex functionality later in the week and implemented React into the project in week two. Worked as a whole group to carry out code reviews in the mornings before merging these on to the main branch of our project, then worked in smaller groups later in the day to build out the headline specifications.

# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the two weeks?*
- Yes and no. I pushed myself out of my confort zone and volunteered myself to work on parts of the project where my knowledge was weaker to help me learn, and I spoke up when I wasn't understanding something. However, I felt that the 'pace' of the project was moving too quickly due to some members of the group rushing ahead by working on tickets in the evening then merging them into the project the next morning without everyone fully understanding what the code was doing. A few of us spoke up about this at the end of the first week and the pace did slow down in the second week, but I maybe should have spoken up about this sooner before I felt like I was being left behind.

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- Try to set a pace that works for everyone in the group. I felt like I really did try to speak up about this although perhaps not soon enough and as a result, I often felt like I didn't know what parts of the code were doing/couldn't work on them on my own. I find group work difficult because I like to plan in advance then take an organised approach to carrying out tasks but I find that in a group setting, the people who have the most knowledge/understanding tend to race through the tickets without as much planning/refelction as I'd like which can make it difficult for me to keep up.
