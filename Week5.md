# Week 5

## Weekly Goals:
- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs.
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges).
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives.
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow.
- Give and receive meaningful code review.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through a week long group-based project where we will build a clone of AirBnB.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- **MakersBnB Challenge** - Creation of a web app which mimics the behaviour of 'AirBnB'. Spent a week working in a group of five to organsie our own work using [XP Values](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/makersbnb#xp-values) to guide our behaviour and the [Development Workflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/makersbnb#development-workflow) to follow the correct process for raising issues, branching, reviewing, approving, and merging our code. Started by turning the specification into user stories then using these stories to create an MVP which we built over the first few days. We gradually added more complex functionality later in the week. Worked as a whole group to carry out code reviews in the mornings before merging these on to the main branch of our project, then worked in smaller groups later in the day to build out the headline specifications.

# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Yes and no. I definitely pushed myself out of my comfort zone and volunteered myself to work on parts of the project where my knowledge was weaker to help me learn. However, I felt that we got a bit caught up in the first few days by learning a new tech (Sequel for Object Relational Mapping). This sounded like a good idea when it was proposed by another group member so I was happy to try it out, but I quickly felt like it was going over my head a bit.

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- Think twice before trying to learn something new during a week intended for consolidation of knowledge. I knew that I had already been struggling a bit with the concept of databases and how to link these to a web app, so I should have continued using the PG method that we'd learned during week 4 instead of introcuing Sequel. A lot of the errors we were getting were related to our databases/tables and I felt a bit powerless to solve them because I'd already been struggling with the PG method.
