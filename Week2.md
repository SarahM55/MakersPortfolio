# Week 2

## Weekly Goals:
- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### How I will achieve this:
- Attend the 'Code Reviews' workshop on Monday and carry out a review of my partner's airport challenge (first weekend challenge).
- Read through any feedback left on my airport challenge and make appropriate changes (if required).
- Work through the 'Oystercard' paired programming exercise. Use this as an opportunity to learn to split and refactor classes.
- Work through the OOP and mocking practicals/resources provided in the course materials to ensure understanding.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
1. **Oystercard Challenge** -
