# Week 2

## Weekly Goals:
- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### How I will achieve this:
- Attend the 'Code Reviews' workshop on Monday and carry out a review of my partner's airport challenge (first weekend challenge).
- Read through any feedback left on my airport challenge and make appropriate changes (if required).
- Work through the 'Oystercard' paired programming exercise. Use this as an opportunity to learn to split and refactor classes.
- Work through the OOP and mocking practicals/resources provided in the course materials to ensure understanding.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
1. **Oystercard Challenge** - Demonstrates examples of splitting and refactoring classes, as well as unit testing classes in isolation using mocking. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/Oystercard-Challenge.git).
2. **Takeaway Challenge** - Demonstrates examples of SRP and refactoring classes, as well as mocking. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/takeaway-challenge).
3. Continued to use Week 1's skill - practiced TDD and Debugging via the Oystercard challenge, and improved understanding of OOP by refactoring the program.
4. Completed a peer code review and provided my partner with feedback on their weekend coding challenge (evidence held by Makers).


## Daily Goals

#### Monday 31st January ✅
- GOAL: To review my partner's code from the 'airport' weekend challenge.
- PLAN: To complete the code review and give feedback where necessary.
- EVIDENCE: Completed on 31/01 - held by Makers.


#### Tuesday 1st February ✅
- GOAL: To understand Gemfiles (struggled with this at the start of the Oystercard exercise).
- PLAN: To read through all of the resources provided in the challenge walkthrough.
- EVIDENCE: Read all of the Gemfile resources from the [challenge outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/oystercard/01_create_gemfile.md), as well as some additional online resources.


#### Friday 4th February ⏳
- GOAL: To understand class polymorphism.
- PLAN: Go through the Polymorphism skills workshop from the course outline. Complete the 'OO Relationships 1 (Forwarding, Polymorphism)' practical.


# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Almost. I felt that I didn't have as much self learning time this week as I needed/would have liked because we had quite a few workshops. I definitely feel more confident with the concept of Gemfiles and have continued to practice TDD, but I didn't get time to do any Polymorphism practicals which would have been really helpful.

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- Be more comfortable with a learning goal taking more than one day to achieve, especially on days where I don't have a lot of self learning time.
