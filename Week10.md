# Week 10

## Weekly Goals:
- Solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code.
- Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
- Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through the Bank Tech Test to practice producing the best code I can when there is a minimal time pressure.
- Practice my OO design and TDD skills.
- I will work alone, and also review my own code so I can practice reflecting on and improving my own work.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
