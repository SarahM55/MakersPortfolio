# Week 4

## Weekly Goals:
- Build a simple web app with a database.
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications.
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables).

#### How I will achieve this:
- Work through the 'Bookmark Manager' paired programming exercise to learn how to build a web app with a database.
- Practice debugging using the Capybara and Sinatra test frameworks.
- Read up on the basics of how databases work using the course materials and online resources to ensure understanding.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
- **Bookmark Manager Challenge** - Creation of another web app. Demonstrates implementation of GET/POST methods using Sinatra and Capybara. Projects split into lib/spec/views folders to preserve separation of concerns. Also demonstrates creation and use of databases within a web app. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/bookmark-challenge.git).
- **Chitter Challenge** - Weekend challenge used to reinforce understanding of the above. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/chitter-challenge.git).
- Did a lot of debugging in Capybara as I build the above apps (however, no recordings available).
- Read a full handbook on [Routing with Ruby](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/routing-with-ruby).


## Daily Goals

#### Monday 14th February ✅
- GOAL: To gain an understanding of how databases work.

# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Almost: I would have liked to have spend some more time on debugging but I was struggling more with understanding the ins and outs of how we build a web app and therefore thought it was important that I dedicate more time to this.

### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- I found this week's afternoon challenge very difficult. I felt like I couldn't make any progress on the exercise at all without relying heavily on the walkthrough which felt a bit disheartening - it didn't really feel like I was reinforcing my learning from last week, instead it felt like I was adding on another layer than I didn't really understand. I'd like to try to make more time to do more reading around the steps of the walkthrough when I'm completely reliant on it.
