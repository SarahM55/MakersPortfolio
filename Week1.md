# Week 1

## Weekly Goals:
- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.
- Pair using the driver-navigator style.
- Follow an effective debugging process.
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Attend the TDD workshop on Day 2 and complete the 'Boris Bikes' pair programming exercise.
- Work through TDD exercises and practicals provided in the course resources. 
- Spend 4 hours each day working with a different pair programming partner (following best practices to maintain collaborative repositories). Request feedback from each partner.
- Attend the Debugging workshop on Day 4 and debug at least 2 Ruby programs which have multiple syntax and testing errors.
- Read the 00 resourced and Work through the exercises provided in the course week outline.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
1. **Boris Bikes** - Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bikes challenge [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/boris_bikes.git) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit and feature testing. Completed over a week of pair programming with different partners.


## Daily Goals

#### Wednesday 26th January ✅
- GOAL: To ensure my understanding of the 'why', 'when', and 'how' aspects of Test Driven Development. To understand the difference between unit and feature tests. Become comfortable with how to present user stories in diagram format.
- PLAN: To read through the ['The 4 phases of a test'](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/four-phase-test) and the ['The three rules of TDD'](https://gist.github.com/R4wm/a0ea5cba323d945625141e0c98238c64) resources provided in the course content and try to complete at least one practical. Read through the ['Decision tree'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) article. Read through [this article](https://mixandgo.com/learn/ruby-on-rails/feature-vs-integration-vs-unit-tests) on feature/unit tests.
- EVIDENCE: Completed reading and the ['Design Strategies'](https://github.com/SarahM55/design_strategies_1.git) practical exercise.


#### Thursday 27th January ✅
- GOAL: To be able to debug something during/following the debugging skills workshop.
- PLAN: Watch the ['Cipher Debugging Video'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGdBqNGvBFY&ab_channel=MakersAcademy) and complete the 'Debugging Approaches' practical from the course resources.
- EVIDENCE: Watched video. Completed the ['Debugging Approaches'](https://github.com/SarahM55/Debugging-Approaches) practical exercise.


#### Friday 28th January
- GOAL: Understand some basic principles of OO programming - encapsulation and SRP.
- PLAN: Read the ['Encapsulation'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29) resource. Do some reading around SRP. Work through the OO exercises from the course resources.
- EVIDENCE: 'Calculator' exercise from skills repository - completed [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1) with image of IRB test.
