# Week 1

## Weekly Goals:
- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.
- Pair using the driver-navigator style.
- Follow an effective debugging process.
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Attend the TDD workshop on Day 2 and complete the 'Boris Bikes' pair programming exercise.
- Work through TDD exercises and practicals provided in the course resources. 
- Spend 4 hours each day working with a different pair programming partner (following best practices to maintain collaborative repositories). Request feedback from each partner.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
1. **Boris Bikes** - Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bikes challenge [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/boris_bikes.git) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit and feature testing. Completed over a week of pair programming with different partners.

PLAN: To read through the 'The 4 phases of a test' and the 'The three rules of TDD' resources provided in the course content and try to complete at least one practical.
