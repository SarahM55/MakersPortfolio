# Week 1

## Weekly Goals:
- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.
- Pair using the driver-navigator style.
- Follow an effective debugging process.
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.

#### How I will achieve this:
- Attend the TDD workshop on Day 2 and work through the 'Boris Bikes' pair programming exercise.
- Work through TDD exercises and practicals provided in the course resources. 
- Spend 4 hours each day working with a different pair programming partner (following best practices to maintain collaborative repositories). Request feedback from each partner.
- Attend the Debugging workshop on Day 4 and debug at least 2 Ruby programs which have multiple syntax and testing errors.
- Read the OO resources and Work through the exercises provided in the course week outline.

#### Evidence that I have achieved this:
1. **Boris Bikes** - Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bikes challenge [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/boris_bikes.git) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit and feature testing. Completed over a week of pair programming with different partners.
2. **Airport Challenge** - Followed a client's specification to write a program to govern the taking off and landing of planes (with edge cases). Demonstrated TDD and SRP. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/airport_challenge.git).
3. Completed a simple exercise demonstrating understanding of TDD. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/design_strategies_1.git).
4. Debugged some erroneous scripts. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/Debugging-Approaches.git).
5. **Calculator Challenge** - Demonstrated understanding of OOP and SRP for classes. Repo [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1).


## Daily Goals

#### Wednesday 26th January ✅
- GOAL: To ensure my understanding of the 'why', 'when', and 'how' aspects of Test Driven Development. To understand the difference between unit and feature tests. Become comfortable with how to present user stories in diagram format.
- PLAN: To read through the ['The 4 phases of a test'](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/four-phase-test) and the ['The three rules of TDD'](https://gist.github.com/R4wm/a0ea5cba323d945625141e0c98238c64) resources provided in the course content and try to complete at least one practical. Read through the ['Decision tree'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) article. Read through [this article](https://mixandgo.com/learn/ruby-on-rails/feature-vs-integration-vs-unit-tests) on feature/unit tests.
- EVIDENCE: Completed reading and the ['Design Strategies'](https://github.com/SarahM55/design_strategies_1.git) practical exercise.


#### Thursday 27th January ✅
- GOAL: To be able to debug something during/following the debugging skills workshop.
- PLAN: Watch the ['Cipher Debugging Video'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGdBqNGvBFY&ab_channel=MakersAcademy) and complete the 'Debugging Approaches' practical from the course resources.
- EVIDENCE: Watched video. Completed the ['Debugging Approaches'](https://github.com/SarahM55/Debugging-Approaches) practical exercise.


#### Friday 28th January ✅
- GOAL: Understand some basic principles of OO programming - encapsulation and SRP.
- PLAN: Read the ['Encapsulation'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29) resource. Do some reading around SRP. Work through the OO exercises from the course resources.
- EVIDENCE: 'Calculator' exercise from skills repository - completed [here](https://github.com/SarahM55/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1) with image of IRB test.


# Reflection

### Question 1
*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*
- Yes, I feel that my confidence with TDD and my practices in particular have really improved. I was able to make a good attempt at the Airport Challenge which is something that I wouldn't even have known how to approach before this week.
- My debugging skills have also greatly improved - instead of panicking when I get an error message, I'm able to work through it logically to solve the problem.
- I've really enjoyed paired programming - I've had a lot of nice feedback from my partners and as someone who usually prefers to work alone, I've really benefitted from being able to bounce ideas off someone else and look to them for guidance.


### Question 2
*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
- I feel more knowledgeable when it comes to OOP, but I would like more time to do some more practicals.
- I'd like to be more strict with taking breaks during paired programming. Once I get stuck into it, I often don't realise the time passing until I suddenly feel exhausted.
